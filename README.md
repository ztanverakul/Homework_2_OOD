# Homework_2_OOD

I converted our original Shape class and subclasses into a python object. The subclasses only change the behavior of the object by representing different instances of shapes. The Shape class does not what type of shape it is dealing with, but it deals with each in the same way. Testing and initializing the list containing the database were the largest differences between this program and it's iteration written in java. Static variables are not used in python so that utility was delegated to a public method. Encapsulation is not as widely used in Python compared to Java and henceforth is not as well represented in this code.
